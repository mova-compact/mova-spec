# MOVA – Security Layer (Core)

> Audience: authors of instruction profiles, platform owners, security engineers, and tool builders who must enforce safety and policy constraints in MOVA-based systems.

This document describes the **security layer** of MOVA. All schemas remain `_core_v1`; the security layer is a mandatory part of the red core for every MOVA product.

It is aligned with the following schemas, catalogs and examples:

- `ds.security_event_episode_core_v1.schema.json`
- `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1.schema.json`
- `env.security_event_store_v1.schema.json`
- `env.security_event_store_v1.example.json`
- `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1.schema.json`
- `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1.example.json`
- `global.security_catalog_v1.json`
- `ds.mova_episode_core_v1.schema.json`
- `global.episode_type_catalog_v1.json`
- `ds.mova4_core_catalog_v1.schema.json`

## 1. Purpose and scope

The MOVA security layer (red core) aims to:

- provide a **standard way to describe policies and guardrails** (instruction profiles);
- provide a **standard way to record security events** as episodes;
- offer a **shared vocabulary** for security event types and actions;
- make security decisions **auditable, analysable and evolvable** over time;
- ensure every MOVA product **carries and records** its security intent and evidence.

The security layer:

- does not prescribe specific algorithms for detection or enforcement;
- does not implement access control or cryptography;
- does not depend on a specific vendor, runtime or product.

Instead, it defines **contracts** that any executor or platform can use:

- to attach policies to MOVA artefacts;
- to report security events in a structured way;
- to track and evolve a **security model** across versions without breaking prior data.

---

## 2. Security model in MOVA

The security model in MOVA is expressed through three main building blocks:

1. **Instruction profiles**

   - `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1.schema.json`
   - `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1.schema.json`

   Instruction profiles describe **what is allowed, denied, logged or transformed** in a MOVA-based system.

2. **Security events**

   - `ds.security_event_episode_core_v1.schema.json`
   - `env.security_event_store_v1.schema.json`

   Security events record **what actually happened** from a security perspective: violations, detections, blocks, fallbacks.

3. **Security catalogs**

   - `global.security_catalog_v1.json`

   Security catalogs define shared identifiers for:

   - `security_event_type`
   - `security_action_type`
   - high-level policy profiles.

These elements are linked by a common field:

- `security_model_version` — indicating which version of the security model a profile or event is written for.

---

## 3. Core security artefacts (mandatory)

The security layer of the red core consists of the following required artefacts:

- `ds.security_event_episode_core_v1` — base shape for security event episodes.
- `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1` — policy and guardrail instruction profiles.
- `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1` — envelope for publishing instruction profiles.
- `env.security_event_store_v1` — envelope for recording security event episodes.
- `global.security_catalog_v1` — catalog of security event types, action types and policy profiles.

Any MOVA product MUST:

- have at least one active instruction profile (`ds.instruction_profile_core_v1`) published via `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1`;
- be able to record security event episodes via `env.security_event_store_v1`, including `policy_profile_id` and `policy_ref` when available;
- align event and action types with `global.security_catalog_v1` (extensions via namespaced ids are allowed, but base types must remain available).

---

## 4. Instruction profiles

Instruction profiles describe **how executors and guards must behave** with respect to instructions, inputs, outputs and tools.

### 4.1. Core schema

Instruction profiles are defined by:

- `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1.schema.json`

Each profile instance is a JSON document that includes at least:

- `profile_id`  
  Stable identifier of the profile (for example `mova_security_default_v1`).

- `profile_version`  
  Version of this profile (for example `"1.0.0"`).

- `security_model_version`  
  Version of the security model the profile conforms to (for example `"1.0.0"`).

- `status`  
  Profile status (`draft`, `active`, `deprecated`).

- `applies_to`  
  A collection of selectors indicating **where** the profile applies:
  - executors (by id, type or environment);
  - roles;
  - envelopes (`env.*`);
  - data types (`ds.*`).

- `rules`  
  A list of rules. Each rule typically contains:
  - `rule_id` — unique id of the rule within the profile;
  - `description` — human-readable description of the rule (policy statement, not a prompt);
  - `effect` — what should happen if the rule is triggered:
    - `allow`
    - `deny`
    - `warn`
    - `log_only`
    - `transform`
  - `target` — what the rule inspects:
    - target kind (input, output, envelope, executor, tool, etc.);
    - selectors (paths, ids, patterns).
  - `severity` — severity level (`info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`);
  - `on_violation` — recommended security actions (see `global.security_catalog_v1.json`).

Profiles may also contain:

- references to documentation;
- audit information (who created or approved the profile);
- extension fields for vendor- or organisation-specific metadata.

### 4.2. Publishing profiles

Instruction profiles are distributed using the envelope:

- `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1.schema.json` (+ example)

This envelope has:

- `envelope_id = "env.instruction_profile_publish_v1"`;  
- `verb = "publish"`;  
- roles, for example:
  - `publisher` — component or authority that publishes the profile;
  - `executor` or `guard` — target system that should enforce the profile;
- a payload field (for example `profile`) carrying a `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1` document.

Publishing a profile is a **declarative act**:

- it does not force immediate enforcement;
- it informs executors and guards about available and updated profiles.

Executors and guards should:

- receive and validate profiles;
- decide, based on local configuration, which profiles to apply;
- record security events when violations or suspicious conditions are detected.

The example `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1.example.json` contains the `mova_security_default_v1` profile aligned with the red core catalog.

### 4.3. Relationship to instructions for AI models

Instruction profiles are part of the **red core** and are written in a neutral, declarative manner.

They should not:

- contain raw prompts or model-specific instruction text.

Instead, they may:

- refer to text channels and fields that contain `model_instruction` text (see `global.text_channel_catalog_v1.json` and `ds.ui_text_bundle_core_v1`);
- express constraints such as:
  - “Do not execute tools of type X in this environment”;
  - “Do not accept user input containing personal data without confirmation”;
  - “Do not forward raw user text to external APIs”.

Executors and guards are responsible for interpreting these rules and applying them to concrete models and tools.

---

## 5. Security events and episodes

Security events represent **observations of security-relevant situations** in a MOVA-based system.

### 5.1. Core security event episode

Security events are recorded as episodes using:

- `ds.security_event_episode_core_v1.schema.json`

This schema extends `ds.mova_episode_core_v1` and includes at least:

- `episode_type`  
  An episode type of the form:
  - `security_event`
  - or `security_event/<subtype>`, for example `security_event/prompt_injection_suspected`.

- `security_event_type`  
  An identifier of the event type (from `global.security_catalog_v1.json`), for example:
  - `prompt_injection_suspected`
  - `instruction_profile_invalid`
  - `forbidden_tool_requested`
  - `other`.

- `security_event_category`  
  A broader category (from `global.security_catalog_v1.json`), such as:
  - `input_validation`
  - `policy_violation`
  - `runtime_error`
  - `other`.

- `severity`  
  Severity level (from `global.security_catalog_v1.json`), for example:
  - `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`.

- `policy_profile_id`  
  Id of the active profile that was applied or violated (if applicable).

- `policy_ref`  
  Reference to the specific rule or policy section involved.

- `security_model_version`  
  Version of the security model used to interpret the event.

- `detection_source`  
  Component or layer that detected the event:
  - `llm_guard`
  - `runtime_proxy`
  - `ui_layer`
  - `monitoring_service`
  - other.

- `detection_confidence` (optional)  
  Confidence value for the detection, for example a numeric score or a qualitative label.

- `recommended_actions`  
  Recommended actions from the perspective of the security model:
  - `action_type` values must come from `security_action_type` in `global.security_catalog_v1.json`.

- `actions_taken`  
  Actions that were actually applied:
  - `action_type` values must come from `security_action_type` in `global.security_catalog_v1.json`.

The base episode fields (`episode_id`, `recorded_at`, `executor`, `result_status`, `result_summary`) remain available and must be populated consistently.

### 5.2. Storing security events

Security events are stored using the envelope:

- `env.security_event_store_v1.schema.json` (+ example)

This envelope has:

- `envelope_id = "env.security_event_store_v1"`;  
- `verb = "record"`;  
- roles such as:
  - `producer` — component that detected or generated the event;
  - `security_store` — log or storage for security events;
- a payload field (for example `event`) containing a `ds.security_event_episode_core_v1` document.

The purpose of this envelope is to:

- transmit security event episodes to security storage;
- ensure that they are recorded in a consistent shape;
- provide clear roles for producers and stores.

Executors and guards should use this envelope whenever a security-relevant event is considered significant enough to be recorded. The example `env.security_event_store_v1.example.json` demonstrates a `security_event/prompt_injection_suspected` episode aligned with `global.security_catalog_v1`.

### 5.3. Examples of security events

Typical events that should be recorded as security episodes include:

- detection of **prompt injection** attempts;
- requests to **forbidden tools** or resources;
- attempts to bypass policies (for example using hidden channels);
- mismatches between expected and actual instruction profiles;
- suspicious access to sensitive data;
- abnormal patterns in usage that trigger alerts.

The concrete set of event types and categories is defined in `global.security_catalog_v1.json` and may be extended over time.

---

## 6. Security catalog and action types

`global.security_catalog_v1.json` is the normative source for security vocabularies in MOVA:

- `security_event_type`, `security_event_category` and `severity` in `ds.security_event_episode_core_v1` must use ids defined in the catalog (or namespaced extensions that do not shadow core values).
- `recommended_actions[*].action_type` and `actions_taken[*].action_type` must use ids from `security_action_type[*].id`.
- Policy profile ids referenced by `policy_profile_id` should correspond to catalogued profiles (for example `mova_security_default_v1`).

Examples aligned with the catalog:

- Instruction profile: `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1.example.json` (`mova_security_default_v1`).
- Security event episode: `env.security_event_store_v1.example.json` (`security_event/prompt_injection_suspected` with catalogued event and action types).

The catalog remains small and vendor-neutral at the red core level. Organisation-specific values are allowed via namespaced ids (for example `acme.security_action_type/block_proxy`), provided core values stay available and unchanged in meaning.

---

## 7. Security model versioning

The `security_model_version` field appears in several places:

- in instruction profiles (`ds.instruction_profile_core_v1`) as `profile.security_model_version`;
- in security event episodes (`ds.security_event_episode_core_v1`) as `event.security_model_version`;
- in security policy profiles within `global.security_catalog_v1.json`.

Its role:

- **In instruction profiles**: marks the security model the profile was authored against (for example `"1.0.0"`), so executors and guards can choose compatible enforcement logic.
- **In security episodes**: records which security model version was used to evaluate and classify the event.

This separation allows the security layer to **evolve without breaking** old profiles or episodes: legacy data keeps its original `security_model_version`, while newer models can introduce stricter rules or broader taxonomies.

When introducing a new major security model version:

- assign a new `security_model_version` value (for example `"2.0"`);  
- create updated instruction profiles that reference this version;  
- adjust detection and enforcement mechanisms accordingly;  
- ensure that episodes recorded under previous versions remain valid and clearly identifiable.

Executors should know which `security_model_version` they support and reject or handle with caution profiles and events specifying unknown versions.

---

## 12. Policy matching by action_signature (MOVA 6.0.0)

Instruction profile rules (in `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1`) apply to episodes and envelopes. MOVA 6.0.0 introduces a normative matching model that allows policies to target operations at three levels of specificity:

### 12.1. Three levels of policy matching

1. **By `action_signature`** — the most specific match: a rule targets the exact combination `(verb_id, tool_id)`, optionally also `target_kind`. Example: deny `(analyze, retrieval_tool, personal_data)`.

2. **By `verb_id`** — a broad operational rule: applies to all actions with that verb regardless of tool. Example: deny all `delete` operations in the production environment.

3. **By `tool_id`** — a channel/integration rule: applies to all actions through a specific tool regardless of verb. Example: log every action performed through the external API connector.

### 12.2. Normative priority order

**MUST**: Executors and guards MUST evaluate instruction profile rules in the following priority order, applying the **most specific matching rule first**:

```
Priority 1 (highest): action_signature match  — (verb_id, tool_id, target_kind?)
Priority 2:           verb_id match            — (verb_id, *)
Priority 3 (lowest):  tool_id match            — (*, tool_id)
```

If multiple rules at the same priority level match an episode, the rule with the stricter `effect` takes precedence (order: `deny` > `transform` > `warn` > `log_only` > `allow`).

**Rationale**: The action_signature-first order ensures that a specific deny rule for a (verb, tool) combination cannot be silently overridden by a broad verb- or tool-level allow rule. The priority is deterministic and MUST NOT be configurable per profile (only the rules themselves are configurable).

### 12.3. Rule target schema extension

To express the three matching levels, a rule `target` object in `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1` SHOULD use the following fields when matching by action:

```json
"target": {
  "kind": "action",
  "verb_id": "analyze",
  "tool_id": 12003,
  "target_kind": "personal_data"
}
```

- `verb_id` and `tool_id` are optional; omitting one means "match any value for that field";
- `tool_id = 0` explicitly matches tool-less actions;
- `target_kind` is optional; omitting it means "match any target kind".

When `kind = "action"` is set and at least one of `verb_id` or `tool_id` is provided, the rule participates in action_signature matching. Rules with `kind` other than `"action"` use the existing matching semantics unchanged.

### 12.4. Tool-less actions in policies

`tool_id = 0` MUST be treated as a valid, matchable value in policy rules — not as "unknown". A rule that explicitly sets `"tool_id": 0` applies only to tool-less actions. A rule that omits `tool_id` applies to all actions regardless of tool (including tool-less).

---

## Operator frame for security

Security episodes are the application of the operator frame to risks and policies: `policy_profile_id`, `security_model_version`, `recommended_actions`, `actions_taken`, and `risks` align to the frame’s why/risks/result/metrics axes. The security layer in MOVA is expected to be designed and audited using the operator frame described in `mova_operator_frame.md`.

---

## 8. Integration with episodes and genetic layer

Security events are part of the broader **episode and genetic layer**.

- All security events are episodes with `episode_type` starting with `security_event`.
- They share core episode fields and can be analysed alongside `execution/*` and `plan/*` episodes.

This integration enables:

- joint analysis of behaviour and security:
  - how often security events occur in specific scenarios;
  - how security decisions impact outcomes;
- evolution of skills and UX based on security signals:
  - adjusting prompts and flows to reduce risk;
  - tightening or relaxing policies where appropriate.

Aggregators in the genetic layer may, for example:

- count occurrences of certain `security_event_type` values;
- correlate them with specific skills, scenarios, tools or user actions;
- propose changes to instruction profiles or scenarios.

---

## 9. Integration into MOVA-based products

Every MOVA product must meet these minimum integration requirements:

1. **Instruction profiles**  
   Each executor must have at least one active `instruction_profile` published via `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1` and linked to the relevant envelope ids and roles.

2. **Security event logging**  
   Guards/executors that apply security rules must be able to record episodes through `env.security_event_store_v1`, referencing the applicable `policy_profile_id` and `policy_ref`.

3. **Catalog alignment**  
   All security event and action types must align with `global.security_catalog_v1` (extensions via namespaced ids are allowed, but base catalog values must remain accessible).

---

## 10. Responsibilities of executors and guards

Executors and guards in a MOVA-based system have the following responsibilities with respect to the security layer:

1. **Profile handling**

   - Receive instruction profiles sent via `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1`;
   - Validate profiles against `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1`;
   - Decide which profiles to apply in which contexts;
   - Honour `security_model_version`.

2. **Enforcement**

   - Apply rules from active profiles to:
     - envelopes,
     - data,
     - tool calls,
     - user inputs and outputs;
   - take actions defined in rules (`allow`, `deny`, `warn`, `log_only`, `transform`).

3. **Event recording**

   - When security-relevant conditions occur:
     - create `ds.security_event_episode_core_v1` episodes;
     - set `episode_type`, `security_event_type`, `security_event_category`, `severity`, `policy_profile_id`, `security_model_version` appropriately using `global.security_catalog_v1`;
     - record `recommended_actions` and `actions_taken` with `security_action_type` ids;
     - send events via `env.security_event_store_v1` to a security store.

4. **Transparency and auditability**

   - Ensure that security decisions are traceable via episodes;
   - avoid silent enforcement changes without corresponding profile or model updates.

---

## 11. Checklist for security layer integration

When integrating MOVA security into a system:

1. **Implement schema validation**

   - Validate instruction profiles and security events against:
     - `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1`
     - `ds.security_event_episode_core_v1`.

2. **Support profile publication**

   - Handle `env.instruction_profile_publish_v1` envelopes;
   - Make profiles available to relevant executors and guards; ensure at least one active profile per executor.

3. **Adopt security catalogs**

   - Use `global.security_catalog_v1.json` for:
     - `security_event_type`, `security_event_category`, `severity`;
     - `security_action_type`;
     - core policy profiles.

4. **Record security events**

   - Use `env.security_event_store_v1` to store security event episodes;
   - ensure that episodes have consistent `episode_type` and `security_model_version`.

5. **Respect the layered model**

   - Keep the security layer vendor-neutral at the red core level;
   - place vendor-specific enforcement logic in the infra or product layers;
   - keep core catalog values available even when adding namespaced extensions.

---

The MOVA security layer is designed to be:

- **mandatory** — every MOVA product must ship with profiles, event logging and catalog alignment;
- **minimal** — only essential contracts are part of the red core;
- **extensible** — organisations can extend catalogs and profiles via namespaced ids;
- **auditable** — all important events and policies are expressed as structured data and episodes;
- **evolvable** — the security model can grow and change while preserving history.
